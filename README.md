# Math Tool Kit(MTK)

## Introduction

MTK(Math Tool Kit) is a header-only C++ math library providing useful classes and algorithms for scientific computing.

Most of the codes are from the homework and projects of my undergraduate course and I've tried my best to make all interfaces clear and simple. There are some introductions for algorithms in *doc/* and the comments and documents for codes will be added in the future. 

Please feel free if you want to use them, **but these codes are not rigorously tested and there's no guarantee of correctness.**

Please let me know if there are bugs or suggestions, and my email is zeyu.wang.0117@outlook.com.

## Dependencies

This library is based on Eigen (https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen) which you should download before using.
